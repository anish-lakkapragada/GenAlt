<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>GenAlt is a free browser extension, designed for Chrome and Firefox, to use AI to generate alt-text for images on the internet that don&#39;t already have them. GenAlt was created with the help of several visually impaired and blind folks, and was made to make the Internet just a little more enjoyable and accessible. </p>
<p>Once you have installed GenAlt, you don&#39;t have to do anything! Alt-text will be automatically generated, so feel free to just start browsing. </p>
<h2 id="language-support-enable-or-disable">Language Support &amp; Enable or Disable</h2>
<p>GenAlt also allows you to change the language your captions are delivered in, or enable or disable the service without uninstalling the extension. To do these tasks, head on over to the popup (also called extension menu), which is a button on the right of the search bar. There you can find GenAlt (you may want to pin it, if possible), and there you can select whether you would like the alt-text in English (default), Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, or Portuguese. There is also a button to toggle whether you would like GenAlt to be running. </p>
